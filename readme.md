# MINI GAME ARCADE

---

# 1. Project Scope

## Main Goal:

Our team aims to build a ‘Mini Game Arcade’ using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The arcade will feature 2-3 classic browser-based games that are interactive, visually appealing, and responsive. The goal is to create simple games while ensuring smooth gameplays with an appealing interface. Each game will have a consistent design theme. The project will focus on efficient use of web technologies to deliver an enjoyable arcade experience in the browser itself.

## Key Features / Deliverables:

• A central landing page to access all included games.
• At least two completed games (e.g., Rock Paper Scissors, Tic Tac Toe, or Whack-a-Mole).
• Consistent UI/UX across games with smooth transitions.
• Scoreboard or result displays for each game.
• A responsive design compatible with both desktop and mobile.

## Out of Scope for Now:

• Persistent data storage (e.g., saving scores across sessions).
• User login/authentication features.
• Multiplayer or online real-time gameplay.

# 2. Milestones and Timeline

a) Sprint Kick-off (Planning Phase):
• Finalize game ideas and responsibilities.
• Set up GitHub repository and base file structure.

b) By “Game Structure with Co-pilot Session:
• Have logic for one game (e.g., Rock Paper Scissors) implemented with Co-pilot help.
• Basic UI layout of at least one game ready.

c) By “Mid-Sprint Demo + Feedback” Session:
• Two games functional with basic styling and working logic.
• Navigation between landing page and games complete.
• Conduct internal playtests and fix basic bugs.

d) End of the sprint:

1. Final version deployed using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
2. Fully tested and styled games.
3. Optional third game added if time permits.
4. Documentation and brief project walkthrough ready.

# 3. Team Roles and Responsibilities

Varsha: She’s the lead developer for the Rock Paper Scissors game, focusing on user-experience and smooth gameplay. She’ll also work on UI consistency and shared styling across all games to ensure all games maintain a unified theme across the arcade.

Jessica:
She’s designing and implementing the Tic Tac Toe game, ensuring clean layout and engaging interactions. She’ll also ensure that the game is mobile responsive, adapting to different screen sizes smoothly.
Tejas:
I’m building the Whack-a-Mole game features like countdown timer and real time score tracking and increasing difficulty levels. In addition to that, I will be a helping hand in JavaScript debugging and support with enhancing game logic across all games to ensure a smooth user experience.
Jeevan:
He’s designing and developing the landing page, the central hub of the arcade. He will also handle the integration of all games into a single arcade implementing navigation and routing features.

Collaboration Strategy:
• Fixed primary responsibilities but flexible to help one another.
• Daily stand-ups (short team sync-ups) to update progress.
• Use GitHub pull requests and a WhatsApp group for smooth coordination.

# 4. Anticipated Challenges and Strategies

## Potential Challenges:

• Merging different code styles and structures into one smooth experience.

• Managing time effectively and sticking to deadlines.

• Making the games bug-free and ensuring cross-device compatibility.

• Maintain clean, modular code and follow a shared folder structure.

• Test regularly after each feature is implemented.

• Support team members who are blocked or stuck.

• Stick to GitHub workflow (branches, pull requests, reviews) for cleaner collaboration
